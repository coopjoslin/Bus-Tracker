# Bus Tracker project
## Created with starter code from MIT xPro program
### Description
  This project tracks bus stops going between the MIT and Harvard campuses, with animated icons on the map.
  
### How to Run
  To run this program, click the button on index.html and the map will appear.
  
### Roadmap
 I'd like to redo this map for my local area. There's not a particularly good bus tracker here, so it would be great to fill that void.
